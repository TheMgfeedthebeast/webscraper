# webscraper
a tool to scrape the web!


This is the documentation for webscraper one of many comming tools to search the web and some stuff I can't tell now

-----------------
to eddit the code of the project, you will need and ide or text edditor of your choice and then open up the scraper.py in here you will see all the code of the program 
every line is commented but here are some things i reccomend changing:

1. For j in search(query, tld="co.in", num=30, stop=30, pause=2
   were it says num= and stop= there is a number in the py file I recomend changing it because it controlls how many results you will get 30 means 30 padges at once you get it?
   I have not checked the limmit so no prommices for it beeing stable! so don't blame me!
-----------------

errors!

If you get errors downloading any packages:
1.Check your internett acsess and run diagnostics like "ping google.com" in your terminal 
-1.check your firewall and make a rule to allow the program search up how to do so, I am not your mom!
-2.IF THIS DOES NOT WORK PLEASE OPEN A ISSUE

2.if you get errors while downloading the padges most likely the padge in question does not aloow to be downloaded so long thats the errors you get just know nothing is wrong if not create an issue

3.any another issues make an issue in the issue tab! wow that was alot of issues in one sentance

-----------------

rules!

1.This is open source do not yell at me please I am only human

-----------------



This is not done so yeah.
